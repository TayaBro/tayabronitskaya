When you use our store services, you trust us with your information. This Privacy Policy is meant to help you understand what data we collect, why we collect it, and what we do with it. When you share information with us, we can make our services even better for you. For instance, we can show you more relevant search results and ads, help you connect with people or to make sharing with others quicker and easier. As you use our services, we want you to be clear how we’re using information and the ways in which you can protect your privacy. This is important; we hope you will take time to read it carefully. Remember, you can find controls to manage your information and protect your privacy and security. We’ve tried to keep it as simple as possible.</dd>\r\n    <dt class=\"heading-5\">Right to access, correct and delete data and to object to data processing</dt>\r\n    <dd>Our customers have the right to access, correct and delete personal data relating to them, and to object to the processing of such data, by addressing a written request, at any time. The Company makes every effort to put in place suitable precautions to safeguard the security and privacy of personal data, and to prevent it from being altered, corrupted, destroyed or accessed by unauthorized third parties. However, the Company does not control each and every risk related to the use of the Internet, and therefore warns the Site users of the potential risks involved in the functioning and use of the Internet. The Site may include links to other web sites or other internet sources. As the Company cannot control these web sites and external sources, the Company cannot be held responsible for the provision or display of these web sites and external sources, and may not be held liable for the content, advertising, products, services or any other material available on or from these web sites or external sources.</dd>\r\n    <dt class=\"heading-5\">Management of personal data</dt>\r\n    <dd>You can view or edit your personal data online for many of our services. You can also make choices about our collection and use of your data. How you can access or control your personal data will depend on which services you use. You can choose whether you wish to receive promotional communications from our store by email, SMS, physical mail, and telephone. If you receive promotional email or SMS messages from us and would like to opt out, you can do so by following the directions in that message. You can also make choices about the receipt of promotional email, telephone calls, and postal mail by visiting and signing into Company Promotional Communications Manager, which allows you to update contact information, manage contact preferences, opt out of email subscriptions, and choose whether to share your contact information with our partners. These choices do not apply to mandatory service communications that are part of certain store services.</dd>\r\n    <dt class=\"heading-5\">Information We Collect</dt>\r\n    <dd>Our store collects data to operate effectively and provide you the best experiences with our services. You provide some of this data directly, such as when you create a personal account. We get some of it by recording how you interact with our services by, for example, using technologies like cookies, and receiving error reports or usage data from software running on your device. We also obtain data from third parties (including other companies). For example, we supplement the data we collect by purchasing demographic data from other companies. We also use services from other companies to help us determine a location based on your IP address in order to customize certain services to your location. The data we collect depends on the services and features you use.</dd>\r\n    <dt class=\"heading-5\">How We Use Your Information</dt>\r\n    <dd>Our store uses the data we collect for three basic purposes: to operate our business and provide (including improving and personalizing) the services we offer, to send communications, including promotional communications, and to display advertising. In carrying out these purposes, we combine data we collect through the various store services you use to give you a more seamless, consistent and personalized experience. However, to enhance privacy, we have built in technological and procedural safeguards designed to prevent certain data combinations. For example, we store data we collect from you when you are unauthenticated (not signed in) separately from any account information that directly identifies you, such as your name, email address or phone number.</dd>\r\n    <dt class=\"heading-5\">Sharing Your Information</dt>\r\n    <dd>We share your personal data with your consent or as necessary to complete any transaction or provide any service you have requested or authorized. For example, we share your content with third parties when you tell us to do so. When you provide payment data to make a purchase, we will share payment data with banks and other entities that process payment transactions or provide other financial services, and for fraud prevention and credit risk reduction. In addition, we share personal data among our controlled affiliates and subsidiaries. We also share personal data with vendors or agents working on our behalf for the purposes described in this statement. For example, companies we\'ve hired to provide customer service support or assist in protecting and securing our systems and services may need access to personal data in order to provide those functions. In such cases, these companies must abide by our data privacy and security requirements and are not allowed to use personal data they receive from us for any other purpose. We may also disclose personal data as part of a corporate transaction such as a merger or sale of assets.</dd>\r\n</dl>','2018-09-18 12:06:49','2018-09-18 14:04:02',1,0,'','','',NULL,NULL,NULL,''),(5,'Customer Service','1column','','','customer-service','Customer Service','<div class=\"customer-service\">\r\n    <div class=\"text-block customer-service__block\">\r\n        <h3>Delivery</h3>\r\n        <h4>Hello and welcome to the shipping and delivery information page!

The brand is now owned by the French multinational company Kering. Balenciaga had a reputation as a couturier of uncompromising standards and was referred to as \"the master of us all\" by Christian Dior. His bubble skirts and odd, feminine, yet \"modernistic silhouettes\" became the trademarks of the house.\r\nCristóbal Balenciaga opened his first boutique in San Sebastián, Spain, in 1917, which expanded to include branches in Madrid and Barcelona. The Spanish royal family and the aristocracy wore his designs, but when the Spanish Civil War forced him to close his stores, Balenciaga moved to Paris.\r\n\r\nBalenciaga opened his Paris couture house on Avenue George V in August 1937, and his first fashion show featured designs heavily influenced by the Spanish Renaissance. Balenciaga\'s success in Paris was nearly immediate. In the period of two years, the French press lauded him as a revolutionary, and his designs were highly sought-after. Carmel Snow, the editor of Harper\'s Bazaar, was an early champion of his designs.','','','1'),('5','Briggs and Riley',1,'briggs_and_riley','Briggs and Riley','Briggs-Riley_Logo.png','Briggs-Riley_Logo.png','Briggs-Riley_Logo.png','Three little words...Engineered for reality.','Three little words...Engineered for reality.\r\n\r\nWhen you’re traveling, they can mean the difference between fast or frantic, relaxed or riled. You see, at Briggs & Riley we do what many consider unthinkable these days. We listen. To customers, to retail partners, to our team of repair experts. Then we design our bags around real-world needs and wants. A handle mounted on the outside of a bag to create more room and flat packing. A pocket to hold toiletries or safeguard your passport. An expansion system that adds capacity then compresses your belongings securely in place. In fact, we have multiple patents designed to make travel, well, easier. It’s innovative thinking like this—never for innovation’s sake—that sets Briggs & Riley apart. Now combine all that with the only unconditional lifetime guarantee in the business. It’s no wonder our customers are nothing short of fanatical about our bags.\r\n\r\nOur impact on the industry and insight into consumers’ needs goes far beyond design. When founded in 1993, Briggs & Riley revolutionized the travel industry by offering many firsts such as a no questions asked “Simple as That®” lifetime warranty, that even covers damage caused by an airline. This guarantee, like no other in the industry, is a reflection of our commitment to building lifelong relationships with customers and covers every bag that we have ever made, from 1993 through 2019 and beyond.\r\n\r\nEngineering firsts established by Briggs & Riley include the patented Outsider®handle design. With no trolley handle bars inside the bag, travelers get a flat packing area inside the case for more capacity and wrinkle-free clothing. We also introduced the NXpandable®system, which provided zipper-less one-touch rigid bag expansion as well as the first checkpoint-friendly SpeedThru™laptop bags in 2008. Our most recent breakthrough is considered to be the patented CX expansion compression system, allowing bags to expand up to 33% then compress down to original size. In fact, we at Briggs & Riley hold multiple patents designed to make travel simpler.\r\n\r\nIt’s our legacy of innovative thinking like this—never for innovation’s sake—that ultimately sets Briggs & Riley apart.','','','1');
